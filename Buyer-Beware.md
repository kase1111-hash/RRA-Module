Buyer Beware: A Note on Responsibility in an Open Code Market

The systems described here are powerful—but they are not magic, and they are not a guarantee of value.

If what you are being offered sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

This marketplace does not curate, endorse, or certify the software being sold. It provides infrastructure, not judgment. The agents negotiate. The contracts execute. The ledger records. That’s it.

Caveat Emptor. Let the buyer beware.

You are not shopping in a managed store—you are walking through an open bazaar. The stalls are run by developers, companies, and agents acting on their behalf. Some are brilliant. Some are careless. Some may be dishonest. The system makes no promise otherwise.

Before you buy:

Read the repository.

Review the tests.

Verify the license terms.

Demand a demo, sandbox, or proof of functionality if it matters.

Understand exactly what access you are receiving—and what you are not.

On-chain settlement does not mean on-chain truth.

A cryptographic license proves that a transaction occurred, not that the code will meet your expectations, integrate cleanly, or be supported forever. Reputation signals help, but they are not a substitute for due diligence.

This is an empty market by design.

There are no gatekeepers. No platform guarantees. No refunds enforced by policy. The freedom to sell without permission comes with the responsibility to buy with care.

You are the ones operating the stalls.
You are also the ones choosing where to spend your money.

Use judgment. Ask questions. Walk away when something feels wrong.

Powerful tools demand informed users.
